### Get deterministic Ethereum contract address from deploy address with Javascript or Python 

When deploying multiple contracts that work together it can sometimes be helpful to know ahead of time what the contract address will before you deploy it. Here are two quick and dirty examples of how to get contract addresses ahead of time one using Python one using Javascript.  The scripts are forks with some updates from this post https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-ethereum-contract-computed/63235#63235.  HT to Dan@Paradigm for pointing me towards this solution.  

- JS script is using v14.15.5
- PY script is using Python 3.9.0
